# Streamlit ML Model Guide with Docker

Welcome to this step-by-step guide on building a simple Streamlit app that hosts a machine learning modelâ€”and deploying it using Docker. This project is designed for beginners, so no prior experience with Streamlit or Docker is required!


## Overview

In this project, you'll learn how to:
- Create a basic web interface with Streamlit.
- Integrate a machine learning model into the app.
- Containerize the app using Docker for easy deployment.

By the end of this guide, you'll have a working app running locally and a Docker image you can deploy anywhere.


## Step 1: Fork the Repository

## Step 2: Set Up Your Python Environment
In terminal: pip install -r requirements.txt

## Step 3: Set up Your Streamlit App (add code)

## Step 4: Run the Streamlit App Locally
In terminal: streamlit run app.py

## Step 5: Run the Dockerfile
In terminal: docker compose up
